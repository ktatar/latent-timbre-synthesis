# Latent Timbre Synthesis

Timbre Space is a deep learning audio synthesis architecture that learns from audio sample dataset.. 

## Latent Timbre Synthesis using Variational Auto-Encoders
We combine Auto-Encoder based architectures with inverse audio synthesis to generate a latent audio space for musical applications.
